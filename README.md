# 🏠 Real Estate Data Automation & Analysis

This project demonstrates the use of **AutoClean** for automated data preprocessing and **PandasAI** for natural language-driven analysis on a real estate dataset. These notebooks were part of a broader Azure-based machine learning pipeline for predicting property sale prices.

---

## 📌 Objectives

- 🧼 Automatically clean and preprocess messy real estate data using **AutoClean**.
- 💬 Perform intuitive data exploration by asking natural language questions using **PandasAI**.
- ⚡ Enhance analysis efficiency and accessibility for non-technical users.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools

- **Python** (Jupyter Notebooks)
- **AutoClean** – Smart data cleaning automation
- **PandasAI** – Conversational analysis over pandas DataFrames
- **Azure SQL Database**

## 💡 Sample Questions with PandasAI

- "What is the average sale price in each city?"
    
- "Which property type has the highest median price?"
    
- "Show the number of listings per neighborhood."
